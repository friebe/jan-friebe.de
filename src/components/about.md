I was born 1992 in Gelsenkirchen and has been working in the digital media since 2009.  

Ambitious, willing to learn and passionate developer with fun and interest in new technologies. I feel most comfortable in frontend dev as well as in the design of web and print media.

The journey began with a passion for creativity and a hobby for drawing, design and the dedication to art. After completing my education as a design assistant in digital and print media, I decided to extend my digital and technical skills in addition to the creative part. I completed a further training as an IT specialist in the field of application development in order to create a symbiosis between technology and design.

I quickly realized that there was more to learn besides creativity on the web and that the world of programming languages offers endless possibilities.

Mostly I deal with design and frontend things. Especially I build things with JavaScript/TypeScript or other cool languages or tools. I use different frameworks, libarys or static site generators. Besides the frontend development I follow current web trends in articles and blogs. I like to attend online courses for further education and often take part in meetups, conferences, seminars, camps and workshops. I am happy to pass on my acquired knowledge at event talks. I like the variety and the people who burn with enthusiasm for their work.

Besides topics of frontend development design and UI/UX I am interested in general topics like SEO and performance. Outside of programming and helping my wife take care of our kid. I am interested in the UFC and NBA and do sports like jogging or boxing. I like cooking and books about self-organization, biographies of great personalities and non fiction books.

As a JavaScript lover and enthusiast I am interested in the basics of the language, just like in UI frameworks, their ecosystems and toolings.

I like to look at successful and beautiful web projects and test them out. Code best practices, patterns and code quality a la clean code play an important role in my everyday life as a developer.
